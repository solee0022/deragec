# deragec
üåü The official implementation for the ACL 2025 paper **_DeRAGEC: Denoising Named Entity Candidates with Synthetic Rationale for ASR Error Correction._** üåü

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
- Python 3.10
- PyTorch 2.5.1
- Transformers 4.45.0
- CUDA 12.4

To create the conda environment, run:
```
conda env create --file environment.yaml
```


## üìö Dataset

We provide one **Common Voice** (`cv`) datapoint and one **STOP** (`stop`) datapoint as example inputs for inference. These can be found in the `examples` directory.

- The raw **Common Voice** test set used in our work is available from the [HP dataset repository](https://github.com/Hypotheses-Paradise/HP-v0).
- The raw **STOP** test set is available from the [STOP dataset repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/audio_nlp/nlu).


## ü§ñ Model
To evaluate our method, we apply two language models to both named-entity filtering and generative error correction:

- **Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct** (AWQ-INT4) ‚Äî ```hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4```
- **GPT-4o-mini** ‚Äî ```gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18```

All experiments are performed in a *training-free* manner, relying solely on *in-context learning* to evaluate the effectiveness of our explicit denoising approach.


## üè∑Ô∏è Named Entity Database

- Named entities can be extracted from the [Common Voice training set](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets) using the following script: ```utils/extract_ne.py```
- Additional media entities can be obtained from this open-source resource:
https://github.com/apple/ml-interspeech2022-phi_rtn
- Definitions for named entities can be collected using the Wikipedia API. 


## üöÄ Inference
#### Filterining Named_Entities
To run the filtering process and generate the filtered results in the output folder, execute the following command:
``` 
python inference_filtering.py --method DeRAGEC --data_type cv
# method = [RAGEC+MCQ|RAGEC+MCQ+PS+Def|DeRAGEC]
# data_type = [cv|stop]
```
The filtered output will be saved automatically to the ```output``` directory.

#### Generative Error Correction (GEC)
To run the GEC module and generate corrected outputs, execute the following command:
``` 
python inference_gec.py --method DeRAGEC --data_type cv
# method = [GEC|RAGEC|RAGEC+MCQ|RAGEC+MCQ+PS+Def|DeRAGEC]
# data_type = [cv|stop]
```
The corrected output will be printed directly to the console.
